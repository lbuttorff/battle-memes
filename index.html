<h1>Battle Memes</h1>

<h2>Project Description</h2>
Battle Memes is a brand new social media platform for comparing the greatest memes. Have you ever wanted to see whether or not your funny cat photo is, in public opinion, better than someone else's? This platform allows you to do just that, and so much more. The idea is to create a posting site similar to Twitter and Facebook but specifically for funny photo comparisons and memes. 

<h2>Project Design</h2>
<h3>Technologies</h3>
The important technologies for this application are Spring framework, JQuery, Maven, and MySQL.
<h3>Use Cases</h3>
1. CRUD a user account
2. Post photos, videos, and other forms of memes
3. Challenge someone else's meme for public voting
4. Vote on which meme is better in a challenge
<h3>Extra Design Documents</h3>
Nothing needed as of now.

<h2>Project Schedule</h2>
For the first checkpoint on this project, I shall complete the first use case by the first checkpoint and begin the second use case by then as well. By the second checkpoint, I will need to have the second use case completed and begin the third. At the third checkpoint, the third and fourth use cases will need to be done in order to begin final testing. To finalize the project, I will do testing and ensure that the four main use cases are implemented correctly and thoroughly.

<h2>Project Justification</h2>
<h3>Novelty</h3>
This project came about by determining what useful applications exist out there for social media and what features they lack. While the idea is rather laughable at first thought, the design of the application is to bring a new, more laughter filled, experience to sharing media on the internet. Other social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter do not have this focus on silly social connecting.
<h3>Complexity</h3>
This project includes some work that I have done in the past, but, more importantly, it includes new implementations of technology I have yet to work with. One of these is file uploads and file management with a MySQL database. That feature will require the most amount of work and being able to quickly serve pages with multiple images and videos that are being put head-to-head for the voting system will be quite challenging.
