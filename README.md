# Battle Memes
Welcome to the future of social media! Our goal here at Battle Memes is to create a social media platform geared around laughter and entertainment.
I strive to give users a new perspective on memes by allowing them to post and vote on memes.

See our project proposal [here on our GitHub.io page](https://lbuttorff.github.io/battle-memes/)

## Framework
I chose to use Spring MVC as the framework as a way to learn a new tool. It has its challenges, as does any framework, but I have mostly enjoyed the process. I hope to bring the best and dankest features to this platform as I develop it for a class project and for fun.

I am using Hibernate to manage data through a MySQL connection. I believe big players like Facebook use NoSQL solutions but that is out of the scope of this project.
