# Battle Memes
Welcome to the future of social media! Our goal here at Battle Memes is to create a social media platform geared around laughter and entertainment.
I strive to give users a new perspective on memes by allowing them to post and vote on memes.

See our project proposal [here on our GitHub.io page](https://lbuttorff.github.io/battle-memes/)

## Framework
I was forced to use Spring Boot and Spring MVC as the framework for this project. As with any system where the guides, documentation, and actual implementations differ, it is a crappy application. I do not understand why anyone would choose this framework to develop in, it is far too confounded for its own utility. I highly recommend using a framework like Play, because of its simplicity and ease of access to the new MVC developer.
